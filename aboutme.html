            Hello, my name is Christian Mukai and I am currently a student enrolled at Clovis High School and CART and I am living in Clovis, California. I am taking a web development class at CART and am trying to major in computer science. I have learned how to program in HTML and CSS and I am currently learning JavaScript. I have also learned to use other programs like Photoshop and how to make a wireframe. I worked in Clovis, California at the Sierra Vista Mall as a person who sells baked goods in a little kiosk. Other work I have done is at a farm in Arizona. My job there was to make sure all the machines were working properly and also to make sure everyone was doing their jobs correctly.
        </p>
        <p class="am">
            A few of my personal hobbies consist of computer gaming and playing card games. I play a lot of video games in my off time with my friends and I also occasionally make an earning from tournaments I attend. I’ve been playing card games for the past seven years of my life, going from Uno to Magic: The Gathering. I have learned lots of qualities from my hobbies like how to work as a team and even things like good sportsmanship. I would hope to join the web development field and make websites for the best of everyone! If you would like to meet with me or check out my current projects, my contacts are listed here: <a href="mailto://ctmukai@gmail.com">Email</a>; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-mukai-493a31149/">LinkedIn</a>
