The article website Scientific American talks about how cyberbullying is directly linked to teen depression and suicides, “investigated the effects of cyberbullying on health in teens ages 12 to 18… There were consistent associations between exposure to cyberbullying and increased likelihood of depression…” Stephanie Pappas, Scientific America."

                In my Web Application and Development class at CART we had to write an essay about digital responsibility and cyberbullying. I did all of my research and we submitted our essay into
                <a href=”http://turnitin.com/”>Turnitin</a>. My essay consisted of research on many teens who have taken their lives due to cyberbullying and I tried to make a hypothesis on why this happened and how we can stop it.

Teenagers of today are very insecure about their bodies, whether it is because of their weight or even something natural like face acne."

                In my Web Application and Development class at CART we wrote an essay on whether or not the book “Ready Player One” should be implemented into high school english classes as part of their curriculum. We wrote as part of the MLA format and should be in an argumentative format. I selected this sample because I believe I worked very hard on this essay and I believe I made a good standpoint for my topic.
